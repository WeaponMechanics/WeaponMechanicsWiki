## Creating/Modifying Configs

I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) when modifying `.yml` files.

When creating a new weapon, copy and paste an existing weapon, then change/add config options. For example, if you want the gun to deal more damage, you should check out the [damage](weapon-modules/damage/ "mention") module. You can now adjust the numbers however you want using that wiki page.&#x20;

Check out [weapon-modules](weapon-modules/ "mention") for more information on creating weapons.

## Support

WeaponMechanics, its addons, and all our other plugins would not exist without some financial backing. Even if you cannot support me financially, please consider leaving a 5-star review. It attracts new people to buy my plugins, giving you more features. A win-win!
